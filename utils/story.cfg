Also in TWoD (acronym ""The World of Death"") you can earn experience by accomplishing story missions. For example, this dialog is first Story mission. You earn 10 xp for this. When you will have enough experience you will be able to select, what you want to increase: hitpoints, speed, damage or number of attacks. So level by level you will be more and more powerfull."
